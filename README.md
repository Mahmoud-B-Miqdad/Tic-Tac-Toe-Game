# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
 The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game developed in C# using Windows Forms. It provides a simple yet interactive interface where players take turns placing "X" and "O" symbols on a 3x3 grid, competing to form a winning line. This project demonstrates fundamental game logic, user interface design, and score tracking in C#.

# Features:
Gameplay: Players alternate turns, placing either an "X" or an "O" on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a win condition each turn, declaring a winner if a player aligns three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Score Tracking: The game displays results after each round and keeps track of player scores.
Reset Functionality: Players can reset the game board and scores to start a new game.
Visuals: Images are used to represent the "X" and "O" symbols, and the interface visually highlights winning sequences.
# Technologies Used:
Language: C#
Framework: .NET Framework 4.7.2
IDE: Visual Studio
Graphics: Windows Forms with PictureBox for images and Labels for player prompts and score display.
# How to Play:
Start the Game: Launch the application to open the main game screen.
Make a Move: Players take turns clicking on cells in the grid to place their symbol (either "X" or "O").
Check Results: The game will display if there’s a winner or a draw after each turn, and the score will update accordingly.
Reset or Close: Players can reset the game board by clicking the "Reset" button or close the game by clicking "Close."
# Files and Structure:
frmTicTacToeGame.cs: Implements the core game logic, including player move handling, win condition checking, and board updates.
frmResults.cs: Manages the results screen, displaying the game outcome and scores.
Program.cs: The main entry point that launches the application.
